    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "On average, black job applicants are less likely to be called back for a interview than their white counterparts. Given the results of this study, we can state this with great confidence. Of course, we're left with many follow up questions that can refine the specificity of our claim. Are there particular industries, regions, and employers that the problem is localized to? We can expect all of these variables to have had some impact on the average behavior.\n",

    "Our initial study has provided a clear answer to the question \"Is there racial bias in the hiring process?\". If our goal is to understand and eliminate this bias, then our natural next step might be to begin dissecting those variables which contribute to the average behavior we've successfully measured.\n",

    "### 5) Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "No, our analysis sought to establish that race was an impactful factor in callback success, all other factors being controlled for. To compare the impact of racial bias to other variables, such as years of experience, we could do similarly controlled tests on those individual variables. Our current data might lead us to useful findings in this regard if we measure the impact of each variable on the binary outcome using a technique like logistic regression. Of course, we would need to carefully reduce the covariance between the measured variables and with other lurking variables. Deconstructing the results of a principal component analysis might offer a useful way forward for finding an orthonormal basis of success factors in which race would is one vector.\n",
